# Discord-Roulette
JS Web App that displays a random Discord message from your chosen chat

# Making it Work
You'll need:
- https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter

Use DiscordChatExporter to generate a JSON file of your chosen channel/DMs and name it what whatever you want. Click the 'Upload JSON..' button and choose your JSON file. Don't worry, all the processing is happening locally, and your messages are never uploaded to the server. You can check the source to verify that if you want.

Then, just press space to get a new random message. YouTube thumbnails are clickable and open the video in a new tab. Images may take some time to load, so if the message looks blank just wait a second or so.

Enjoy!
